With this plugin, you can update your .qgz project from an url or upload a new .qgz.

Usage example:
your coworkers use all the same project on their phones, store in local,
you, you store this project.qgz on github repo and to update it, you just have to send them the repo link to update it themself via QField

URL from github, could be just : https://github.com/user_name/repo , it will complete your link with your project.qgz name at the end and other terms to make it downloadable

You can also upload a .qgz file with a different name than your project.qgz file in the project folder, it will alert you and you need to check the checkbox to enable it.
